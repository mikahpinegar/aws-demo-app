# aws-demo-app
This app will be used to demo skills with React/Next.js and Node.js and AWS resources like Lambdas, EC2, and Dynamo DB

# Architecture
1. A React app built with Next.js hosted on an EC2 instance with PM2 + nginx
2. A Node.js + Lambda backend
3. Most likely a DynamoDB database for simplicity
4. Resources will be managed using Cloudformation or Terraform
5. CI/CD will be setup if I have time
